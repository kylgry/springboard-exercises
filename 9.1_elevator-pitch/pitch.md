I have a decade of experience in mechanical engineering product development, from Stirling engines and electric vehicles to x-ray sources. My expertise is in product reliability and manufacturability. I've recently expanded my skill set in the software development space, and am looking for opportunities in software development with companies focused on quality and reliability.
