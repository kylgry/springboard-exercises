I am an engineer with a decade of experience developing products, including Stirling engines, electric vehicles, and x-ray sources. My expertise is in product reliability and manufacturability. I've recently added software engineering to my skill set. I am interested in developing reliable and quality products using as much of my mechanical and software engineering skill set as possible.
